# FeynRules Model Files

Hold the FeynRules files for distinct model implementations

## Files


* [DiagonalCKM](./DiagonalCKM.rst): restriction file for a diagonal CKM matrix

* [LorentzTadpole](./LorentzTadpole.gen): generic model file for FeynArts needed for NLO calculations

* [Massless](./Massless.rst): restriction file for massless quarks

* [Massless](./Massless.rst): restriction file for massless quarks

* [SM](./SM.fr): full SM model file

* [SMQCD](./SMQCD.fr): simplified SM model file containing only QCD and quarks

* [SMS-stop](./SMS-stop.fr): UV BSM model with a scalar top partner and a fermionic DM candidate

* [Top-EFT](./Top-EFT.fr): model file with the relevant EFT operators and the coefficient values.

* [Top-FormFactors](./Top-EFT.fr): model file with relevant counter-terms and some dim6 operators. This model is supposed to be used to generate a basic UFO model, which then can be modified to include form factors.
