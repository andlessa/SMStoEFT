#GroupMagic

The GroupMagic subpackage was coded by **Anders Eller Thomsen** and was included in the **Matchete v0.1.0** release and is distributed under its License. It has since been integrated more direcly in the Matchete package to provide a more seamless user experience. GroupMagic provides a wide range of group theory capabilities in particular as it relates to the contraction of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The subpackage has also received contributions from **Julie Pag√®s**.
