re# Matchete changelog

## v0.3.0
- Added option `ReductionIdentities` to perform simplifications in either $d=4$ or $d=4-2\epsilon$ space-time dimensions, including the possibility to map results to an evanescent-free version of the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ renormalization scheme.
- Added documentation for all functions and objects in the built-in Mathematica documentation center, which can be accessed conveniently with the \`F1\` key. (w.i.p.)
- Added support for flavor indices on diagonal mass matrices (and other diagonal tensors in flavor space) in the matching and simplifications. 
- Introduced `MapEffectiveCouplings` to obtain WC in a particular basis from a generic Lagrangian. 
- ___Breaking changes:___ 
	- File format for model files for `LoadModel` significantly simplified (view documentation for details). 
	- Gauge field normalization changed such that gauge couplings appear in front of gauge kinetic terms rather the in covariant derivatives.  
	- `EOMSimplify` defaults to `ReductionIdentities -> EvanescentFree`, meaning that the Lagrangian is transformed to the evanescent free renormalization scheme.  
- Minor changes:
	- Added function `SuggestBibliography` to generate bibtex entires with appropriate citations.
	- `DefineField` options `Charges` and `Indices` now accept single entries in addition to lists.
	- `DefineGroupRepresentation` is now deprecated in favor of `DefineRepresentation`.
	- Removed the `` GroupMagic` `` context in favor of using `` Matchete` `` everywhere.
	- The documentation for the group theory fatures has been updated and changed to tech notes in the Mathematica documentation center. Simply search for "GroupMagic" and "CG Coefficients". 
- Performance and improvements:
	- Optimized `GreensSimplify` for dimension-8 operators.
	- Changed construction of composite operators in `GreensSimplify`.
	- $ \gamma_5 $-odd ``DiracTrace``s are now performed consistently with NDR following the KKS prescription. Details can be found in the tech note on "Dirac Algebra" in the Mathematica documentation center.
    - Implemented memoization for ``DiracTrace``.
	- Reduced memory usage when matching models with many particles and interactions.
	- Optimized the way coefficients are simplified in calls of `GreensSimplify` or `EOMSimplify`.
	- Greatly improved notebook file size from `NiceForm` output.


## v0.2.0 (2024-04-22)
- Traces are now computed covariantly with Wilson lines rather than CDE. Improved `Match` performance at one-loop order.
- Match automatically identifies heavy and light fields and updates the masses according to the Lagrangian.
- Introduced option `DummyCoefficients -> True/False` in `EOMSimplify`.
- Implemented `GetOperatorCoefficient` to extract coefficients of specific EFT operators.
- Improved the ability of `GreensSimplify` to determine when operators trivially vanish under symmetry.
- Collection of coefficients in `CollectOperators` and `GreensSimplify` now accounts for flavor symmetries of operators.
- Improved performance of `GreensSimplify`.
- New, robust implementation of `HcSimplify`.
- Various bug fixes:
    - Fixed `ContractCGs` for higher dimensional groups.
	- Fixed `GreensSimplify` bug with flavor indices.
	- Fixed `GreensSimplify` bug with multiple gamma matrices on the same fermion line.
	- Allows `HcTerms` as input in various functions.
	- Allows constants in `GreensSimplify` and `CollectOperators`.

### v0.1.8 (2024-02-19)
