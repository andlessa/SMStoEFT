#: name: Cut flow for Mono-V (low purity), DM, spin-0 mediator
#: description: Unweighted signal acceptance times efficiency at every cut stage. The requirements called "HCAL mitigation" refer to the requirements imposed in the 2018 data set in order to mitigate the localized failure of the HCAL detector.
