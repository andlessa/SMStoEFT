# Instructions on how to run Contur

## Installation

The [myrivet_bootstrap](./myrivet-bootstrap) script will install Rivet and all its necessary dependencies using the compatible versions of each library.

[Contur](https://gitlab.com/hepcedar/contur) can then be installed running [installer.sh](./installer.sh).

This can be done running:

```

Rivet can then be run with:

```
